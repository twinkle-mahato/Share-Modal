# Share-Modal
This is a simple and responsive Share Modal App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create a modern popup modal for sharing content via social media platforms. The modal appears when the "Share" button is clicked and disappears when closed, all handled through JavaScript event listeners.
