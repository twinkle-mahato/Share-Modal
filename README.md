🔹 Project Overview

The Share Modal App is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create a clean and modern modal popup that allows users to share content or links via social media. The app is interactive, responsive, and focuses on enhancing user experience using basic web development skills.

🔹 Features Explained

This app includes essential UI/UX features that make it feel like a professional component. When the user clicks the “Share” button, a popup (modal) appears on the screen with various social media icons such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. The modal can be closed by either clicking the close (×) icon or clicking outside the modal area (on the overlay). The smooth open/close behavior is controlled through JavaScript.

🔹 Event Listeners in JavaScript

JavaScript plays a crucial role in this project. It uses event listeners to handle all user interactions. These include:
Opening the modal when the Share button is clicked.
Closing the modal when the close icon is clicked.
Closing the modal when the user clicks on the overlay area outside the modal box.
Each of these actions is managed using the addEventListener() function, making the app dynamic and responsive to user actions.

🔹 Technologies Used

The app is built with three core web technologies:
HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage, including the modal, overlay, and share button.
CSS is used for all styling — such as colors, positioning, transitions, and responsive design.
JavaScript handles the logic behind showing and hiding the modal using class manipulation and event listeners.

🔹 How It Works

When the app loads, the modal remains hidden. As soon as the user clicks the "Share" button, a JavaScript function adds an .active class to the modal and overlay elements, making them visible on the screen. When the user clicks on the close icon or outside the modal, the .active class is removed, hiding the modal again. This toggle behavior is controlled entirely using JavaScript.

🔹 Folder Structure

The app consists of three main files:
index.html – contains the main layout
style.css – defines all styles and animations
script.js – contains JavaScript for interactivity
All files are kept simple and well-structured to help beginners understand the logic easily.
